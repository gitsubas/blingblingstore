## ⚠️ Remaining Gaps (Minor / Backend Dependent)

These items are either low priority or best addressed during/after backend integration.

### **1. Order Tracking & History** 📍
- **Status:** Basic order history exists.
- **Gap:** Detailed timeline (Processing -> Shipped -> Delivered) and real-time tracking updates will rely on backend status updates.

### **2. Email Notifications** ✉️
- **Status:** Not Implemented (Frontend side).
- **Recommendation:** Implement via backend (Node.js/Django/etc.) using services like SendGrid or Nodemailer.

### **3. Discount/Coupon System** 🎟️
- **Status:** Not Implemented.
- **Recommendation:** Define data model in backend first, then add UI input in Checkout.

### **4. Pagination** 📄
- **Status:** Not used.
- **Recommendation:** Implement server-side pagination once backend APIs are ready, as client-side pagination is temporary.

### **5. Breadcrumbs** 🗺️
- **Status:** Implemented in Admin, missing in Public Shop.
- **Recommendation:** Low priority UX enhancement.

## 🚀 Readiness for Backend Migration

**VERDICT: READY** ✅

The frontend is in an excellent state to begin backend development. The data models (Product, User, Order, Cart) are well-defined in TypeScript interfaces and Contexts, which will serve as a perfect blueprint for your database schema.

### **Next Steps (Backend Transition):**

1.  **API Design:** Map existing Context methods (`getProducts`, `login`, `createOrder`) to RESTful API endpoints.
2.  **Database Schema:** Replicate the `Product`, `Variant`, `User`, and `Order` interfaces in your database (SQL or NoSQL).
3.  **Authentication:** Replace `AuthContext` mock logic with JWT-based authentication.
4.  **Image Hosting:** Replace base64/URL logic with actual file upload endpoints (S3/Cloudinary).
